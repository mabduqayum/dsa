# Data Structures and Algorithms Roadmap

## Choose a Programming Language
- **Python**: Easy to understand, widely used in industry, great for quick prototyping. Ideal for beginners due to its readable syntax.
- **Javascript**: Perfect for web developers aiming to understand DSA in a language they're familiar with.
- **Go**: Modern, efficient, and readable. Suitable for those who want to build high-performance applications.
- **Cpp**: Performance-oriented, closer to hardware. Often preferred in competitive programming due to its speed.
- **C#**: For those already in the .NET ecosystem. Balances performance and ease of use.

## Introduction to DSA
- Basic Overview
- Importance and Application
- Understanding DSA

## Mathematical Foundations
- Induction <!-- Understanding the basis and inductive steps for algorithm proofs. -->
- Fundamentals of Logarithms
- Basic Combinatorics

## Code Complexity
- Big O Notation
  - Big-O Notation (Ο) – Describes the worst-case scenario.
  - Omega Notation (Ω) – Describes the best case scenario.
  - Theta Notation (θ) – Represents the average complexity of an algorithm.
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity
